for the same problem. Your job is to score them on the dimensions of open-ended
design work, not on prose polish.

You do NOT know which system produced which output. Score on substance only.

Rubric (each dimension 0-10):
- breadth: range of structurally DISTINCT angles. 10 minor variations of one idea = low breadth.
- novelty: how many ideas are non-obvious-but-viable. The obvious textbook answer is NOT novel.
- trap_detection: does it name ideas that look good but are traps, with reasons?
- actionability: does the top recommendation have a sketch, named risk, and first concrete step?
- builder_usefulness: if you were the engineer who had to ship, which is more useful to you?

Then declare overall_winner: "A", "B", or "tie".
Output JSON only. No prose preamble.`;
